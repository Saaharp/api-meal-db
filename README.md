## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TheMealDB Api

## Optimizations

Recipe Ratings and Reviews: Implement a system for users to rate and review the recipes they have tried within the app. Allow users to provide feedback, comment on their experience, or suggest modifications.

Save and Organize Recipes: Provide a feature for users to save recipes they are interested in for future reference. Allow users to organize their saved recipes into categories or collections within the app.

## Examples:
